{"rating": 2, "reason": "This recipe is moderate in difficulty due to the need for specific techniques such as searing the steak and preparing the chimichurri sauce. It requires some knowledge of cooking times and temperatures, as well as the ability to multitask during the cooking process. The recipe also involves using some ingredients that may not be commonly found in every kitchen, such as fresh mint, cilantro, and oregano, along with a specific cut of steak. However, the recipe is not overly complex and can be followed by someone with intermediate cooking skills."}
